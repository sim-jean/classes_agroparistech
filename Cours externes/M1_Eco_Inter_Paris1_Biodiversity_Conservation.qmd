# Introduction

## COP 16 and biodiversity conservation

![](../images/ecol_econ/biodiv/COP%2016%20Rome.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
-   COP16 in Cali Colombia : meant to bridge the finance gap for biodiversity conservation in the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity
-   Failed to do so in Cali, because of major disagreements
-   Reconvened lately in Rome : agreed to a strategy to raise 200bn per year to finance the international policy goals regarding biodiversity conservation
:::

## Multilateral policy for biodiversity

[Keunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework]{.bg4}:

::: {.incremental style="font-size:90%"}
-   Follows the failure of the [Aichi]{.bg3} targets to halt biodiversity loss
-   Structured around 4 goals by 2050 :

1.  ["Protect and Restore"]{.bg3} : enhance ecosystem health, halt human induced extinction, genetic diversity is maintained
2.  ["Propsper with Nature"]{.bg3} : biodiversity is sustainably used
:::

# 1. Biodiversity : concepts, measures and decline

## A. Definition

::::::: columns
::::: column
-   From [conservation biology]{.bg4}, a subfield of biology created to halt the decline of biological diversity (M. Soulé)

::: fragment
*"Biological diversity "means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems*

Article 2, Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992
:::

::: incremental
-   Different [levels]{.bg3} : within an ecosystem, between ecosystems etc
-   Different [diversities]{.bg3} : structural, functional, genetic

## B. Different types of measures

For an overview of measures used, see Marcon, 2018 [^1]

[^1]: [Eric Marcon, *Mesures de la Biodiversité*, 2018](https://ericmarcon.github.io/MesuresBioDiv2/index.html)

#### Species neutral diversity

::::::: columns
:::: column
::: fragment
-   [Richnesss]{.bg4} : number of classes in a given area <br> ex : number of species of trees in a forest
    -   $\alpha$ diversity for community level
    -   $\gamma$ diversity for meta community level
:::
::::

:::: column
::: fragment
-   [Evenness]{.bg4} : similarity of abudances of each species in an environment <br> ex : a forest with 99% spruce & 1% oak v. a forest with 50% spruce and 50% oak
:::
::::
:::::::

::::::: columns
:::: column
::: incremental
-   [Shannon]{.bg3} index :
    -   Mean measure of surprise that a sample population gives : individual with low probability of occurence gives more information
    -   with $p_i=\frac{N_i}{N}$ and $S$ species richness
    -   $H = -\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \log_2(p_i)$
:::
::::

:::: column
::: incremental
-   [Simpson]{.bg3} index :
    -   probability that two individuals randomly drawn belong to the same species
    -   $S' = \sum_{i=1}^S p_i^2$
:::
::::
:::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Non neutral diversity measures

::: incremental
-   [Dissimilarity]{.bg4} : take into account the distance between members of a class or a species (DNA, branches of a phylogenetic tree)
:::

::: fragment
#### Take home
:::

::: incremental
-   Biodiversity measures are different but highlight the fact that [the sum is more than its parts]{.bg4}
-   As we'll see, depending on what you choose, definitions yield different [conservation strategies]{.bg4}
:::

## C. A worldwide decline

![](../images/ecol_econ/biodiv/drivers_impact.jpg){fig-align="center"}

# 2. Rationales for biodiversity conservation

## A. The concept of Total Economic Value

The concept of [total economic value]{.bg4} emerges from John Krutilla's work (1967, [Conservation Reconsidered](https://media.rff.org/archive/files/sharepoint/News/Features/Documents/071003%20Krutilla-ConservationReconsidered.pdf)):

::: incremental
-   [Use values]{.bg4} can be :
    -   [Direct]{.bg3} : associated with the direct use of ressources from the environment through consumption (fish, timber etc)
    -   [Indirect]{.bg3} : values associated with indirect contributions from ecosystems, such as flood protection, or as inputs in productive activities (pollination)
    -   [Option]{.bg3} : the possibility of using a resource, either for preservation or exploitation, in the future, when technical progress makes it useful
-   [Non use values]{.bg4} :
    -   [Bequest]{.bg3} Value: The value placed on preserving ecosystems for future generations.
    -   [Existence]{.bg3} Value: The benefit derived from simply knowing that an ecosystem or species exists, even if one never directly interacts with it.
:::

## B. Linking Nature to its Values

### Ecosystem services

::: incremental
-   Ecosystem services emerged as a pedagogical metaphor to highlight the [crucial dependence of humans on ecosystems]{.bg3}
-   Became a way to [measure the values]{.bg4} of ecosystems in the 1990s
-   Different types of ecosystem services :
    -   Provision
    -   Regulation
    -   Cultural and Recreation
-   Who provides these services?
    -   [Individual species]{.bg3} for direct use values
    -   [Ecosystems]{.bg3} overall for indirect use values such as water filtration etc
-   Does [species diversity]{.bg4} lead to more ecosystem services?
    -   [Sampling]{.bg3} effect : larger diversity ensures more productive species are present
    -   [Niche differentiation]{.bg3} effect : more species will use resources more efficiently
    -   [Insurance]{.bg3} effect : greater diversity is linked to lower variance of services
-   Results are supported across a wide range of ecosystems
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Towards Nature Contributions to People

::: incremental
-   With criticism surrounding the [commodification]{.bg3} of Nature and to [include non instrumental]{.bg3} values, IPBES recently moved towards the [Nature Contributions to People]{.bg4} framework
    -   Emphasizes the [multifaceted relationships]{.bg4} between people and nature, capturing both [tangible/intangible]{.bg3}, [positive/negative]{.bg3} contributions
    -   Recognizes the importance of [indigenous and local knowledge]{.bg3}, cultural heritage, and ethical considerations in understanding human–nature connections.
:::

## C. Evaluating Ecosystem Services

:::::: columns
::: column
![](../images/ecol_econ/biodiv/costanza_1997.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

:::: column
::: incremental
-   Costanza et al, The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, 1997, *Nature*
-   Find that the natural capital and associated ecosystem services is worth [\$33 trillions]{.bg4}
    -   Still larger than today's GDP
    -   But [lower than the potential infinity]{.bg3} of its value if disappeared
-   [How]{.bg3} would you value ecosystem services? What do you need to know?

Causal study of the impact of the [onset of white nose syndrom in the US]{.bg4} using [staggered difference in difference]{.bg4} on pesticide use and infant health

::: fragment
![](../images/1e_année/science.adg0344-fa.jpg)
:::

::: incremental
-   After the onset of bat die-offs, farmers in the county [increase their insecticide use by 31.1%]{.bg4}, on average
-   Substitution between a declining natural input and a human-made input
-   [Infant mortality rates]{.bg4} due to internal causes of death (i.e., not due to accidents or homicides) [increased by 7.9%,]{.bg4} on average, in the affected counties
:::

# 3. How to conserve biodiversity?

::: notes
-   Rationales for conservation established
-   How can we do?
    -   [Halt overexploitation]{.bg3} with rules for reasonable use
    -   Incentivize [habitat]{.bg3} based measured for conservation
    -   Set up protected areas
:::

## A. Promoting reasonable use of resources and ecosystem based management?

### 1. Bioeconomic analysis of fishery

::: incremental

    -   To understand the link between a scenario and social ecological consequences
    -   Thus excluding strictly correlative methods
-   Featuring [population dynamics]{.bg4}

#### Population dynamics

::: incremental
-   Only [one species]{.bg4} is considered
-   Track the evolution of biomass (in tons) through time
:::

::: fragment
$$
X_{t+1} = F(X_t) + X_t = G(X_t)
$$
:::

::: incremental
-   $F(X_t)$ is the [growth function]{.bg3} of the population (abuse of language : mean growth function)
-   It includes a [density effect]{.bg3} : growth level depends on the population (or stock level) :
    -   It can be large for low levels of population
    -   And low for large levels of population (saturation effect)
    -   A same growth level can happen at two population levels
-   Main example : [logistic growth (Verhulst, 1838)]{.bg3}
:::

::: fragment
$$F(X_t) = rX_t \left(1 - \frac{X_t}{K}\right)$$

with $r$ the [intrinsic growth rate]{.bg3} (for low population levels) and $K$ the [carrying capacity]{.bg3} of the ecosystem (in tons)

#### Biological equilibria

We have an [equilibrium]{.bg4} when the [population is not changing]{.bg4} through time :

::: fragment
$$
\begin{align*}
X_{t+1} &= X_t = X^*\\
\Rightarrow & X_{t+1} -X_t = F(X_t) = 0
\end{align*}
$$
:::

::: fragment
We're looking at a [convergence]{.bg4}, a [long term case]{.bg4}, where things are no longer changing as determined by fixed external factors
:::

::: fragment
#### Extraction technology and sustainable yield
:::

::: incremental
-   Extraction technology : links harvesting effort to harvested quantity such that $$Y_t = h(X_t, E_t)$$
-   Population dynamics change with extraction :
:::

::: fragment
$$\begin{align*} 
    X_{t+1} -  X_t &= F(X_t) - Y_t= F(X_t)-h(X_t, E_t)
\end{align*}$$
:::

::: incremental
-   Equilibrium population is such that fishing exactly equals growth: $X_{t+1}-X_t=0 \iff F(X_t) = h(X_t, E_t)$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   An [equilibrium fishing level, with the associated stock level]{.bg3} is called [sustainable yield]{.bg4} if the fish growth is equal to the fish harvest

-   If $Y_t>F(X_t)$, $X_{t+1}<X_t$

-   If $Y_t<F(X_t)$, $X_{t+1}>X_t$

-   In equilibrium, $h_t(X_t,E_t) = F(X_t)$

-   The [maximum sustainable yield]{.bg4} is the maximal fishing level sustainable in the long term
:::

::: fragment
#### Measurements
:::

::: incremental
-   Effort is [difficult to measure]{.bg3}, as it depends on the technology : km of lines trawled, hooks/km/day etc
-   [Catchability]{.bg3} is difficult to measure and to rely on : here we assume a fixed rate, but it can change! $$Y=q(X)XE$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size:100%"}
::: incremental
-   [North Atlantic Cod]{.bg4} collapsed in the 1990s after decades of overfishing and overcapitalization to [0.1% of its historical level]{.bg4}
-   A [moratorium]{.bg3} was declared in [1992]{.bg3}, causing 37,000 fishermen to lose their job (Canada's single largest layoff in history), that has started to be lifted in 2024
-   Among the reasons for its collapse was a wrong evaluation of the[link between catch per unit of effort]{.bg3} ($Y/E$), [catchability and stock]{.bg3} ($qX$) (see [Rose et Kulka, 1999](https://people.uncw.edu/scharff/courses/458/Discussion%20articles/Rose%20and%20Kulka%201999%20-%20cod%20hyperaggregation.pdf):
-   CPUE was used as an [indicator for abundance]{.bg3}, while the stock actually displayed [hyperstability]{.bg4}!

#### Plugging the economics

::: incremental
-   How do we go from effort to population to dollars?
-   First, recognize that the equilibrium relationship implies that : $$
    \begin{align*}
    &rX^* \left(1 - \frac{X^*}{K}\right) = qX^* E\\
    \Rightarrow & X^* = \left(1- \frac{q}{r}E \right) K \\
    \Rightarrow & Y = qE\left(1- \frac{q}{r}E \right) K
    \end{align*}
    $$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](../images/Ressources_Nat/Diapositive3.JPG){width="80%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   All that's left to do is bring in some economics around effort
-   Define [total revenue]{.bg4} by $RT= pY$ with $p$ the price of the resource
    -   Assume a [competitive output market]{.bg3} (most of the time, but not always the case)
-   Define [total costs]{.bg4} as $CT = cE$ :
    -   Assume total costs do [not depend on the population of fish]{.bg3}
    -   And long term perspective, where entry is at its largest and costs depend on effort proportionally (no need to drag additional people)
    -   Hence, [average cost is marginal cost]{.bg3}
-   [Profit]{.bg4} is thus : $$ \Pi = RT - CE = pY - cE = pqE \left(1 - \frac{q}{r}E \right)K - cE$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Explaining overfishing

::: incremental
-   Gordon introduces the fundamental difference between agriculture and fishing, through the analysis of [differentiated rents]{.bg4} (i.e. economic returns above the "normal" profit level due to varying productivities)
    -   *We now come to the point that is of greatest theoretical importance in understanding the primary production phase of the fishing industry and in distinguishing it from agriculture.*
    -   *In the sea fisheries the natural resource is [not private property]{.bg4} : hence the rent it may yield is not capable of being [appropriated]{.bg4} by anyone. The individual fisherman has no legal title to a section of ocean bottom. Each fisherman is more or less free to fish wherever he pleases*
    -   *The result is a pattern of competition among fishermen which culminates in the [dissipation of the rent of the intramarginal grounds]{.bg4}*
-   Key ideas and concepts are [intramarginal grounds, heterogeneous rents, and lack of property]{.bg4} (i.e. open access)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let :

-   Average revenue (per unit of effort) be: $$RT = pY(E)/E = pq\left(1 - \frac{q}{r}E \right)K$$
-   Marginal revenue : $$Rm = \frac{\partial pY(E)}{E} = pq\left(1 - 2E\frac{q}{r} \right)K$$
-   Average and marginal cost : $$CM = Cm = c$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Two fishing grounds

![](../images/Ressources_Nat/Diapositive11.JPG){width="80%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   When both grounds are optimally managed, effort levels are A and B. Why?
-   That's what matters for a social planner
-   But what would [you]{.bg4} do, as a fisherman? Where would you go?
    -   What matters is not the marginal profit, on aggregate
    -   But as a person, it is the [mean profit]{.bg4}: where will you earn the most?
:::

::: fragment
![](../images/Ressources_Nat/Diapositive11.JPG){.absolute top="240" left="100" width="790" height="500"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   Fishers will [redispatch until profits are equalized]{.bg4} accross zones
-   To this end, profit levels are equal : spatial arbitrage opportunities are exhausted
-   A marginal fisherman would earn the same thing anywhere
:::

::: fragment
![](../images/Ressources_Nat/Diapositive13.JPG){.absolute top="240" left="100" width="790" height="500"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   This phenomenon is repeated for every fishing ground that is [at least more productive than the marginal cost of harvesting,]{.bg3} until the last ground, [the marginal ground]{.bg4}
-   All zones with higher productivity (or profit) are called [intra marginal grounds]{.bg4}
-   Profits get dissipated because of lack of clear property rights

#### Open access equilibrium

![](../images/Ressources_Nat/curve_to_lines_revenue_OA.jpg){.absolute top="50" left="200" height="700"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Comparing policy recommendations

::: incremental
-   We now know that open access is likely to yield to [overharvesting and overcapitalization]{.bg4} of the fisheries
-   What should be implemented?
-   [Maximum sustainable yield]{.bg4} was recommended as the basis for policy
    -   It sill is recommended in the European Union, under the [*Common Fisheries Policy* (2013)]{.bg3} according to a precautionary principle
-   Gordon suggested to aim for the [maximum economic yield]{.bg4}, i.e. the effort level that maximizes profits, thus taking economics into account, implemented in [Australia]{.bg3} for example

::: notes
-   Although EAFM has been formally adopted widely since the 1990s, little is currently known to what extent ecosystem drivers of fish stock productivity are actually implemented in fisheries management.
-   Based on worldwide review of
    -   more than 1200 marine fish stocks
    -   found that such ecosystem drivers were implemented in the tactical management of only 24 stocks.
    -   Most of these cases were in the North Atlantic and north-east Pacific, where the scientific support is strong.
-   However, the diversity of ecosystem drivers implemented, and in the approaches taken, suggests that implementation is largely a bottom-up process driven by a few dedicated experts.

#### Controversy

::: incremental
-   Green et al. (2005), Phalan et al. (2011) : use empirical data that the relationship tends to be convex, promoting [land sparing]{.bg4}

-   [Sparing]{.bg4} tends to be favored in several ecosystems :

    -   Especially in the case of [specialist species]{.bg4} (birds etc)
    -   And in many regions (whether tropical or temperate - see [Edwards et al, *Current Biology*, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220318820) and [Feniuk et al, *Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Britain*, 2019](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2019.1483)) including Europe

-   However :

    -   [All biological diversities may not be impacted alike]{.bg3} : soil v. floral and animal biodiversity
    -   Not all impacts (especially dynamic) are factored in with intensive agriculture [(pesticide use, local pollution, nutrient runoff)]{.bg3}
    -   The tradeoff can be potentially solved : how?

-   Using [agroecology]{.bg4} :

    -   To leverage biodiversity
    -   Into producing larger yields
    -   Such as in India etc

### 3. Using PES for incentive based conservation

::: incremental
-   Idea is to [leverage incentives]{.bg4} to promote biodiversity enhancing policies
-   In the form of [Payment for Ecosystem Services]{.bg4} : habitat provision etc
-   Farmers are being paid by a third party to change their agricultural practices, land use type (fallow etc)
-   Sometimes, this can be leveraged into a [compensation, or offset]{.bg4}, market:
    -   Either through a government policy, i.e. need to pay for the offsetting of a residual impact : 81,000 km$^2$ in 2018
-   Which rests upon 2 assumptions :
    -   [Comparability]{.bg4} : aim for "like for like" compensation, within the same geographical region
    -   [Additionality]{.bg4} : offsets are officially achieved, and in the absence of a payment, there would not have been offsets
-   In practice :
    -   [Biodiversity assessment is simplified]{.bg3} and not thorough, as well not ambitious enough to achieve Not Net Loss

### 3. Efficiency of protected areas

::: incremental
-   Within the protected areas, [species richness and abundance tend to recover]{.bg3}, both on land and at sea
-   Not always the case : [places protected need to be of high ecological value]{.bg4}
    -   Recent results ([Grupp et al, 2024]{.fg}) with the European Union, which protects 26% of land, close to the 30 by 30 target, especially through Natura 2000
    -   Use [staggered difference in difference]{.bg3} (Callaway & Sant'Anna, 2021)
    -   Show that the [results on vegetation cover and nightlight pollution are close to 0]{.bg4}, irrespective of the time of conservation

Two way fixed effects (TWFE) have been showed to be biased in the case of [staggered treatment]{.bg3}, because the standard estimator compares treated units to already treated units

TWFE : $y_{it} = \mu  +\alpha_i + \lambda_t + \delta D_{it} + \beta x_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$

With $\alpha_i$ a unit-specific fixed effect (capturing time-invariant differences across units) and $\lambda_t$ a time-specific fixed effect (capturing shocks common to all units at a given time).

Their approach

::: incremental
-   Finds an [group time Average Treatement effect on the Treated]{.bg3}
-   Comparing each cohort $g$ (treatment starts in $g$) to not yet treated units at time $t$
-   And aggregates them over time to reflect the composition of the treated across time to find the ATE

::: incremental
-   For [marine protected areas]{.bg4} :
    -   When [monitoring and sanctioning are well enforced, see less harvest in protected areas]{.bg3} and promote recovery (See [Sala and Giakoumi, 2018](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/75/3/1166/4098821?login=false))
    -   Otherwise, results are more debated
-   Besides efficiency, the [political economy of MPAs matter]{.bg3} : the [Blue (or Green) Paradox]{.bg4}
    -   Announcing a policy that will force harvesters to reduce their harvest in the futures pulls it back in time, resulting in increased pressure until implementation
    -   [McDermott, Meng et al.,]() 2018, study the Phoenix Islands Protected Areas (Pacific Ocean), one of the world's largest
    -   Find that fishers doubled their effort once area was earmarked for protected status
    -   Amounting to an empoverished starting point equivalent to 1.5y of banned fishing

### 4. Issues with protected areas

::: incremental
-   Approach relies on a [interspecies comparison]{.bg4}
    -   without encompassing [species interactions]{.bg3}
    -   [Different biodiversity metrics]{.bg3} lead different conservation schemes ([Courtois et al., *Ecological Economics*, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800918304956?via%3Dihub)), : which should you chose?
-   Subject to [more than 1 period constraint]{.bg3} :
    -   Dynamic problem of land allocation
    -   Especially with climate change
    -   And exogenously shifting location-specific probabilities for survival
    -   Integer programming problem becomes more difficult to solve
-   May fail to integrate as such the drivers of biodiversity loss and [forgets what people do]{.bg4}
    -   Political economy
    -   Local populations not always associated
-   May be [beneficial]{.bg4} if strong monitoring and [transfer of changed values]{.bg4} (e.g. tourism etc) to local communities

# Conclusion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.incremental style="font-size:95%"}
-   Biodiversity underpins the functioning of essential ecosystem services
-   [And is dramatically threatened by anthropogenic impacts :]{.bg3}
    -   Overexploitation
    -   Habitat loss
-   [Solving overexploitation of species]{.bg3}
    -   Implies regulating fisheries to promote sustainable use
    -   But also feature larger ecosystem based goals to avoid dire ecological consequences
-   [Adopting a more comprehensive approach is thus necessary]{.bg3}
-   [On land, policies aim at protecting habitat]{.bg3}
    -   Either through vertical policies : CAP incentives
    -   Or more horizontal policies through voluntary PES
    -   In more or less anthropized landscapes
-   [The efficiency of policies is encouraging but can be improved]{.bg3} with
    -   More monitoring & communities empowerment
    -   Better targeting, especially in Europe
    -   Better forecasting for PES and favoring in kind compensation
    -   Less red tape to avoid green paradox
    -   and renewed commitment and effort for policy evaluation with causal methods
